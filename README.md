# sign-language-to-audio-converter
The Sign to Audio Language Converter project utilizes OpenCV, TensorFlow, and machine learning to translate sign language gestures into spoken language. Through the integration of computer vision techniques with deep learning models, the system identifies hand gestures captured by a camera, interprets them using trained algorithms, and converts them into corresponding spoken words or phrases. This innovative solution bridges communication barriers for individuals with hearing impairments, enabling them to convey messages effectively through spoken language.
